# PF2e TokenMagic Integration
Bindings for token magic to support PF2e. Inherits a lot of code from TokenMagic.
If you're feeling generous, you can send something through [Paypal](https://paypal.me/carlosfernandez1779?locale.x=en_US) if you want.

Remember to enable "Default template grid on hover" in Token Magic FX settings if you want the same default behavior as 5e. Unfortunately Token Magic forcefully overrides that value to default to false if the system is not 5e.

Needs to be done: Handling for non-damage traits such as water and plant.
